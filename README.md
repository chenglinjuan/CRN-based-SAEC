# CRN-based-SAEC
The implementation of "Deep Learning-based Stereophonic Acoustic Echo Suppression without Decorrelation".

This repository provides an implementation of the CRN model for stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation. More details will be updated soon.

The file path of "Audio_Samples" is a set of wav samples recorded in a real meeting room and the processed results by CRN-based SAES and traditional adaptive-filtering algorithms.
